As of Android 4.0, it is possible to access the device Calendar via Calendar Provider. This was released after this project was completed and therefore this solution only access the Google Calendar in the cloud via the new Google APIs infrastructure, which is one way to go about it for devices with previous releases of Android. 

Credits for this project go to: Sergio Martinez and Juan Miguel Mu√±oz. A description of the motivation for this project can be found here: http://developer.vodafone.com/phonegap-calendar-api-plugin/
